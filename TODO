- Complete the user-module interface. Clean up the directory structure so that
libs can be included.
- Build a series of tables to be included as demos.
- User docs.
- Developer docs.
- Implement the eval changes.
- Make it so that a file run off the command line is taken as the full
filename (tablefile.ts), but imports are done by module name - that is
independent of the file extension. This will let binary modules be loaded.
- Code documentation.

- Fix map element assigns. += doesn't work.
- Classes? Shouldn't be hard now.
- Lambda operators would be really nice.
